### Laboratory work on information protection 

- <a href="https://github.com/RustaMSHar/encryption-algorithms/blob/main/first%20encr/main.py">First encr</a>: The character is replaced by its number in the character table plus a user-defined number;
- <a href="https://github.com/RustaMSHar/encryption-algorithms/blob/main/second%20encr/main.py">Second encr</a>: Rearrangement of even and odd characters in a word is performed;
- <a href="https://github.com/RustaMSHar/encryption-algorithms/blob/main/third%20encr/main.py">Third encr</a> : All letters are replaced with the reversal of odd words;
- <a href="https://github.com/RustaMSHar/encryption-algorithms/blob/main/fourth%20ecnr/main.py">Fourth encr</a> : The original character is replaced by the number obtained: character code from the cipher file - letter number*2;
- <a href="https://github.com/RustaMSHar/encryption-algorithms/blob/main/fifth%20encr/main.py">Fifth encr</a> : Blocks of 6 characters are replaced by 1,4,6 shifted left by 1, for 2,3,5 shifted right by 1.;
